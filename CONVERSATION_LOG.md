## Project: QuickPick Collaborative Calendar

**Date:** May 18, 2025

### Conversation Summary

**TASK DESCRIPTION:**
Build a mobile-first, real-time collaborative calendar app in Next.js with SQLite, where users can create/join sessions, input a username (no auth), and select available dates. The calendar should highlight dates where all users are available, and the UI must be responsive and visually appealing on all devices.

**COMPLETED:**
- Scaffolded a Next.js app with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and SQLite integration.
- Implemented session creation and joining: users can create a new calendar session or join an existing one via a code.
- Added username prompt (stored in localStorage) for session entry.
- Built a backend with API routes for session management and availability tracking, using SQLite.
- Implemented a real-time update system using Socket.IO (custom server on port 4000, Next.js on 3000).
- Created a responsive, mobile-first calendar UI with:
  - Clickable dates for marking availability.
  - Color coding: blue (only you available), pink (others available), green (everyone available).
  - Tooltips on hover/focus showing users who selected a date.
  - Month navigation (prev/next).
  - User list for the session, updated as soon as a user joins.
- Refined the calendar and card layouts for better appearance on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Added a "Home" button to the top left of the calendar page.
- Updated color legend and UI text for clarity.
- Ensured all availability is tied to a session/calendar in the database.
- Provided instructions for inspecting the SQLite database.

**PENDING:**
- No major features pending. All requested UI/UX and backend features are implemented.
- Further visual tweaks or new features as requested by the user.

- `src/app/calendar/[sessionId]/page.tsx` (main calendar UI and logic)
